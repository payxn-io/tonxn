# Tonxn - CDP (Collateralized Debt Position) stablecoin protocol

```
-Deposit Collateral and Borrow pUSD: Users can deposit TON, DOGS, and bridged majors (BTC, ETH, SOL) as collateral.
-They then can mint pUSD, a stablecoin pegged to the USD, against these deposits.
-pUSD can be used for various purposes like trading, saving, or making payments, removing the need for users to sell their crypto holdings.
-Earn Yield with Tonxn Vaults: Users can earn yield on pUSD by depositing into Tonxn Vaults.
-Each vault corresponds to a specific collateral asset, with deposits receiving 75% of the interest generated by debt backed by it in exchange for participating in automated liquidations.
-Vault deposits thus receive pUSD yield and collateral-denominated liquidation profits, with further automation of compounding liquidation proceeds possible.
-On-Chain Savings: pUSD can be redeemed for $1-worth of protocol collateral and has zero off-chain dependencies.
